This is a repository of my homeworks from EC330 - Algorithms and Data Structures.
The actual assignments don't exist anymore, presumably so the teacher can reuse them in future semesters, so I'll explain to the best of my ability what the purpose of each HW was (although I think my code is generally very readable).

HW2: It looks like HW2_NEW was just a function to read in a file containing lines of integers separated by spaces and terminated by the constant TERMINATOR which was set to -999999. Pretty straightfoward.
MaxProduct looks like an extrapolation of that, which reads the lines in and returns the maximum product of the integers from a given input file with their direct neighbors. e.g. input: 2 3 -1 maxproduct: 6.
Problem4a is a string search algorithm and Problem4b takes two input files and merges them into a single output file with the contents of both.

HW3: Just a handwritten template implementation of a linked list, designed for int and char
